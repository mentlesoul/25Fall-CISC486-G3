## Idea Clarity
XXX is a two-player cooperative tower defense game based on grid maps. Two players jointly defend the base camp (HQ) in the same local area network session. The enemy will dynamically change course based on the defense towers newly built or dismantled by the players.

Victory: Health>0 at the end of all waves.

Failure: Any enemy arriving at the HQ will have their shared Health (e.g., initially 20) deducted based on their weight. Failure occurs when Healthâ‰¤0.

Sharing economy: Kill and turn settlements produce a gold and gold is shared between 2 players.

Loading limit: Each player can only carry limited types of towers before entering the level(e.g., 2 or 3 each person, can be different). Division of labor and collaboration are encouraged.

Placement rule: The tower must be placed in a buildable grid. After the server verification is placed, there is still A feasible path (A*) from the entry to the HQ. If it will block the path, then refuse to place it.

Tower (First Batch prototype) :
Archer (low-cost monomer)/Cannon (range sputtering)/Oil (deceleration main)/Tesla (Chain Thunder)/Buffer (Ranged Buff or Debuff)

Enemies (First Batch Prototypes) : Trooper/Armored/Warded/Swarm/Supporter(Enhancer)/Elite Mob(Champion)

Playability: The "instant route change" within Boci turns "road closure - traffic diversion - firepower coverage" into a real-time game. Loading restrictions force teammates to build complementary systems(types of towers should be complementary).
